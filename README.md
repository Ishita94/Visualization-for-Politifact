# Visualization of political statements fact-checked by Politifact

Team project (done with 2 undergraduates of UBC Computer Science Department) of CPSC 447 Data Visualization course, that shows 3 unique D3 data visualizations of 13240 political statements, including a scatterplot of top originators, a stacked bar chart of statement distribution across information sources, and an area chart showing distribution over time. 

- Followed code in this link to zoom in the scatter plot: https://d3-graph-gallery.com/graph/interactivity_zoom.html
- Included moment.js from cdnjs for date manipulation
- Followed code from this link to implement originator searchbox: https://www.w3schools.com/howto/howto_js_autocomplete.asp
- Followed code from this link to implement zoom in scatterplot: https://d3-graph-gallery.com/graph/interactivity_zoom.html
- Followed code from d3-examples

- Showing tooltip while zooming: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58125180/d3-zoom-and-mouseover-tooltip

My roles in this project:
- Propose the research problem and idea of visualizations addressing this problem
- Discuss and collaborate in designing all three visualizations and identify required attributes
- Identify domain-specific tasks, abstract tasks, and related attributes
- Code scatterplot and filter of top originators in D3
- Document and organize meeting minutes among the team, to keep track of deliverables
- Contribute heavily in project reports
